Coldplay web design.
My projects aims to create an immersive online space dedicated to the iconic British band, Coldplay. The keyword is IMMERSIVE! Adding modern flat style and popping visuals with a clean soft pink background look. Ultimately, to create positivity for viewers.

Design Process.
1. Promoting of the ColdPLay group.
2. Allowing users to learn more about the band and it's band members.
3. Let user view the albums and top songs from the band.
4. Updates the user or fan base alike, with the date and location of their upcoming tours.

-As a new user, I want to easily navigate through the website to find information about Coldplay's latest albums and singles, so I can stay updated on their music.
-As a user, I want to access the tour schedule on the website.
-As a user, I want to discover Coldplay's popular music on a interactive website.

Features.
First feature I want to share is the navigation bar. It is responsive and will wrap into a hamburger icon which will then open up a drop down menu for the navigation that is on mobile view.
Second feature is the scrolling effect of the whole website, as i put all the content on a single page, this allow me a lot of spacing to play with effect which i have use effectively.
Third feature is the carousel I had set up in the About us page where it will scroll through three pictures I have carefully selected.
Lastly the final feature is the Spotify I had embed into the music page, so that user can access their music straight off the website.

Feature left to implement.
Another feature I think would further make the web more immersive is to have a interactive concert map. Also a custom playlsit generator for the web visitor would add on a very unique touch to the website.
